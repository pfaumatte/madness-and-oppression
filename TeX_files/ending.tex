As you made your way through this book did you check off any items or answer the questions? Below you’ll find all the questions repeated--you might want to write your answers here, including any of the items you checked, so you have them organized in one place. Afterward, think about how you would like to represent your answers: lists, drawings, a vision board, a wall dedicated to mapping, photo maps, a journal, or an essay all are ways community members have used to showcase their map. You can choose the one that best suits your style, or even mix and match.

Once you know how you want to build your map, choose a setting that is right for you. Some people like to answer these questions in private, with a friend, in a group, or with support from our online community. The Icarus Project also offers mad mapping workshops so you can make your map with the help of a skilled facilitator.

We suggest you take it easy, be honest with yourself, honor your feelings, and reach out for support so you can safely recover from any triggers sharing this information may cause.

If you end up adding your own questions, want to anonymously share your map with others, or want to use this guide for a group we’d love your additions to this community project! Email \href{mailto:madmaps@theicarusproject.net}{madmaps@theicarusproject.net} to let us know.
